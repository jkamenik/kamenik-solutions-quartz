# Skaffold

https://skaffold.dev/

> Fast. Repeatable. Simple

Skaffold is to [[Kubernetes]] what [[Docker Compose]] is to [[Docker]].  This is it is a basic scaffolding that can build and then deploy your images for local testing.  It can also pull in your production [[Kustomize]] or [[Helm]] definitions so that you can use them directly.

This tool fits in the CI stage and very early CD stage.
