# Kamenik Solutions Digital Garden

This is my public website for Kamenik Solutions.

Quartz is the underlying tool used to generate the page.  See [Getting Started](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/#-get-started) for details on quartz.

In order to make it easier to use, DevContainer support was added.

## Update Quartz

Full details [here](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/upgrading), but basically.

`npx quartz update`

Then restart the DevContainer.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an issue with commit signing then you might need to run
> `git config commit.gpgsign false`

## Quartz v4

> “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease-of-use.
